## terms

riot client = RiotClientServices.exe
valorant = VALORANT.exe

## notes

When riot client starts up without the correct homescreen it will force an update on the user
The correct homescreen file has something unique about it, admin privalege does not matter
The homescreen must be added before valorant opens or within the second
